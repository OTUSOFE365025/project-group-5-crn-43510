## 1.1 - Step 1 - Review Inputs

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Design Purpose** | This is a **greenfield system** from a mature domain. The purpose is to produce a sufficiently detailed design to support the construction of a **unified, conversational interface to institutional data at Ontario Tech University**, focusing on **high availability and performance** while strictly adhering to **security and privacy standards**. |
| **Primary Functional Requirements** | From the use cases presented, the primary drivers were determined to be: <br><br> * **UC-1 (Access Academic Details):** Because it directly supports the core business of providing personalized, accurate student information via a natural-language interface. <br> * **UC-2 (Receive Notifications):** Because it is critical for engaging users and ensuring timely communication, directly impacting the platform's utility. <br> * **UC-5 (Regulate System Integrations):** Because it is crucial for system operations, ensuring secure and reliable connectivity with external institutional systems (LMS, Registration) and maintaining data integrity. |
| **Quality Attribute Scenarios** | The scenarios were described in the Quality Attribute Scenarios section. They have now been prioritized (based on the provided Importance and Difficulty ratings) as follows: <br><br> * **QA-1 (Performance)**: Importance: **High**, Difficulty: **High** <br> * **QA-2 (Availability)**: Importance: **High**, Difficulty: **High** <br> * **QA-3 (Security)**: Importance: **High**, Difficulty: **High** <br> * **QA-4 (Scalability)**: Importance: **High**, Difficulty: **Medium** <br> * **QA-5 (Modifiability)**: Importance: **Medium**, Difficulty: **Medium** |
| **Constraints** | All of the operational and technical boundaries discussed in the System Constraints section are included as drivers: <br><br> * **CON-1 (Scalability Requirement):** Support $\ge 5,000$ concurrent users. <br> * **CON-2 (Cross-Platform Access):** Seamless operation across web and mobile browsers. <br> * **CON-3 (Cloud Deployment Environment):** Hosted on a university-approved cloud service. <br> * **CON-4 (Privacy and Compliance):** Strict adherence to institutional policies. <br> * **CON-5 (Performance Target):** Response time $\le 2$ seconds for most queries. <br> * **CON-6 (Unified AI Backend Models):** Reliance on a single underlying AI backend for both voice and text. |
| **Architectural Concerns** | All of the identified design priorities and risks from the Architectural Concerns section are included as drivers: <br><br> * **CRN-1:** Define Overall Microservice and Integration Structure. <br> * **CRN-2:** Utilize Team’s Knowledge of Python (**FastAPI**) and **React** for UI. <br> * **CRN-3:** Ensure Secure Handling of **SSO** and Personally Identifiable Information. <br> * **CRN-4:** Design for Scalability and Cloud Auto-Deployment. <br> * **CRN-5:** Simplify Integration of Future AI Models and External APIs. <br> * **CRN-6:** Provide Clear Module Responsibility Allocation for Team Members. |
