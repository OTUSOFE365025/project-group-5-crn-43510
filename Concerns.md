## 4.2.4 Architectural Concerns — AIDAP

The following architectural concerns were identified during the initial design phase of the AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP).  
These concerns reflect major design priorities and risks that will guide architectural decisions in later iterations of the ADD process.  
Each concern captures a key consideration that impacts maintainability, scalability, and overall system quality.

---

| **ID** | **Concern** | **Description** |
|:-------|:-------------|:----------------|
| **CRN-1** | **Define Overall Microservice and Integration Structure** | Establish a clear, modular architecture separating core services such as natural-language processing, data integration, and user management. Defining service boundaries early ensures maintainability, supports independent deployment, and simplifies scaling of individual components. |
| **CRN-2** | **Leverage Team’s Knowledge of Python (FastAPI) and React for UI** | Utilize technologies already familiar to the development team—FastAPI for backend microservices and React for the web interface—to accelerate implementation and reduce learning overhead. This also ensures maintainable code and rapid prototyping aligned with existing expertise. |
| **CRN-3** | **Ensure Secure Handling of SSO and Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** | Design the authentication and data-handling components to comply with institutional security standards and privacy laws (e.g., PIPEDA). All SSO tokens and user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest, and access must follow role-based authorization. |
| **CRN-4** | **Design for Scalability and Cloud Auto-Deployment** | Architect AIDAP for horizontal scalability using container orchestration (e.g., Docker + Kubernetes). Incorporate CI/CD pipelines to enable automatic deployment and rollback, ensuring continuous availability and fast recovery from system failures. |
| **CRN-5** | **Simplify Integration of Future AI Models and External APIs** | Adopt a plugin-based integration layer that allows future AI services or external data sources to be added with minimal refactoring. This design improves modifiability and future-proofs the system as AI technology evolves. |
| **CRN-6** | **Provide Clear Module Responsibility Allocation for Team Members** | Define ownership and responsibilities for each system module (e.g., frontend, NLP, data API, infrastructure). Clear allocation of work supports effective collaboration, parallel development, and easier testing across sub-teams. |
