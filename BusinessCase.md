## 1.0 Business Case: AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)

---

The **AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)** addresses the need for a unified, conversational interface to institutional data at Ontario Tech University, where existing tools are fragmented and require manual navigation. The core solution integrates with external systems like the LMS, registration, and calendar to provide students, lecturers, and administrators with secure, personalized access to schedules, deadlines, announcements, and academic analytics via **natural-language queries (text or voice)**. AIDAP is designed to be highly available ($99.5$% uptime) and responsive (2-second average latency), ensuring a seamless user experience across mobile and web platforms while strictly adhering to data privacy and security policies through features like single sign-on (SSO).

The strategic implementation of AIDAP promises significant **operational and engagement benefits** by centralizing data access and automating interactions. For students and lecturers, the platform enhances communication through personalized notifications and simplified content management. Administrators gain robust tools for managing integrations, broadcasting announcements, and generating system-wide analytics reports. The project, scoped to include AI processing, data retrieval, and dashboard visualization (excluding core LMS development), represents a crucial investment in **modernizing data access**, improving stakeholder satisfaction, and boosting institutional efficiency and data utilization.
