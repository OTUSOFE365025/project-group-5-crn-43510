## Business Case – AIDAP

### Background
Ontario Tech University aims to enhance student and faculty engagement through a conversational AI assistant. Existing tools (LMS, email, portal) are fragmented and require manual navigation.

### Problem Statement
Students, lecturers, and administrators need a unified platform to access institutional data—course schedules, announcements, analytics—via natural-language conversation.

### Proposed Solution
AIDAP provides an AI-powered digital assistant that integrates with LMS, registration, and calendars, enabling users to query or update data via text or voice. It personalizes responses and ensures data security through institutional SSO.

### Stakeholders
- **Students (S):** End-users querying academic data  
- **Lecturers (L):** Manage content and respond to class queries  
- **Administrators (A):** Configure integrations and monitor usage  
- **System Maintainer (M):** Manages deployment and monitoring  
- **Data Source Systems (D):** LMS, registration, calendar APIs  

### Scope
Includes: AI query processing, data retrieval, dashboard visualization, and notification system.  
Excludes: Development of LMS or registration systems themselves.

### Expected Benefits
- Centralized access to institutional data  
- 2 s response latency under normal load  
- 99.5 % uptime  
- Improved communication and analytics visibility
